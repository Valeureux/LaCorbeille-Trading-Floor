#Trading Floor Game

This game is designed to make participants experienced :

- how trade is affected by the availability of money
- how exchange system affects individual and collective behaviors
- the inevitable result of using debt as money
- how outside control of the money supply can drain a local economy
- how money is separate from real value
- how we can use our intelligence to serve our intentions

By simulating trading in an actual marketplace, the traders feel the difference, which reinforces the learning objectives. The game is designed to need minimum of materials, and it is useful to have a helper to the facilitator and to start by playing the suggested sequence. Please keep notes of metrics here and share them with me to help my research.

##1. Basics

Number of players : 10 minimum until many

Time : 1h minimum for the suggested sequence

Player game objective : to collect as many seeds as possible by exchanging cards to make sets of 4. (E.g. a set of 4 queens)

##2. Materials

    playing cards : (number of players + 4) set of 4 (e.g. for 10 players, take 14 sets so 56 cards)
    At least 3 x (number of players) green pieces of paper.
    Seeds, nuts or sweets in a big bowl
    Volunteer to act as cashier
    Pen and paper for the banker to record loans
    metrics form
    Timer
    Table
    for mutual credit round : mutual credit wallet (see pdf enclosed) + clips

 

##3. Preparation

1. Choose which story you want to tell, identify which game architectures to use, and in what order
2. Set up table
3. Train a cashier to accept sets of cards, give seeds, distribute shuffled cards, and to noting borrowers’ name

 

##4. Explain the rules

Each player starts with 4 playing cards which are exchanged to make a set.
Sets are exchanged by the cashier for 4 mixed cards and one seed.

Game dynamic
Each round takes around 20 mins and consists of the following stages :

    Explain the new rules
    distribute cards and appropriate means of exchange
    TRADING (13 mins)
    Clear the queue for the cashier
    Collect cards
    Count metrics, make players aware and take note
    Call in debts (in some rounds)
    Discuss: What happened? How did you feel?

##5. Suggested Sequence – 1 hour

Round 1 Swapping variation
People have to find double reciprocity to exchange 1 card for 1 card
Players may only accept cards matching a card they already have (that means they cannot help each other by doing exchanges which benefit one participant only)
It may show slow trade and good relations

Round 2 Scarce, Centralised, Debt money variation
Take (Number of players / 2) green papers
Distribute them randomly (0, 1 or 2) while telling how life is unfair…
People have to buy or sell cards to exchange. 1 card for 1 green paper
They can borrow green paper (mean of exchange) , borrow 2 will give back 3
Bank can sell cards
Give enough time
Push loans and take names
At the end of the round CALL IN DEBTS, and exclude debtors
It may show fast trade and bad relations

Round 3 Mutual credit variation
Distribute 1 « mutual credit » wallet per player
People record each exchange by +1 on seller’s and -1 on buyer’s wallet
Centre account have wallet and can sell cards
It may show fast trade, nice relations and need for IT

Final reflection
- Which money system do you prefer?
- Which money system is most like the one we use today?
- What is the function of interest?
- What would happen if seeds could be used to pay debts?
- How should the mean of exchange be issued in order to create the most seeds?
- How architectures/systems affect our behaviours?
- How can we be intelligent and chose the appropriate architecture / context / goal?
- How can we be smart and choose a good architecture / context / goal relation?


##3. Variations

###Swapp
No paper is issued to start.
NB This is very slow and nice

###Fiat Scarcity Debt
few green is issued randomly to some playersm they can borrow 2 and repaid 3
NB This is fast and competitive

###Fiat
2 greens are issued to each player.
NB This is efficient and nice, danger of inflation

###Commmodity money
1 green issued to each player, greens exchangeable for seeds
NB ?

###Mutual Credit
use ‘mutual credit’ wallet with +1/-1
NB fast, nice, need of IT

###Self issued credit
Players issue as many greens with their name on. All greens must return to issuers at the end.
NB Some players unable to redeem all their credit show the need for governance!

###Bank as Trader
A banker enters the marketplace (with unlimited green slips) buying and selling and earning seeds like other players.
NB Note HOW the odds are stacked in favour of the bank. Prices may go up

###Democracy
players decide the rules
NB Don’t worry if you never get around to actually trading
